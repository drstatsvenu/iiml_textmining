Can I create recommendations purely based on the 'intent' and 'context' of the search? How do I use natural language processing techniques to create valid recommendations?This talk will showcase how a recommendation engine can be built with user browser history and user-generated reviews using a state-of-the-art technique - word2vec. We will create something that not only matches the existing recommender systems deployed by websites, but goes one step ahead - incorporating context to generate valid and innovative recommendations. The beauty of such a framework is that not only does it support online learning, but is also sensitive to minor changes in user tone and behavior.The trick/secret sauce is - How do we account for the 'context' and build it in our systems? The talk will answer these questions and showcase effectiveness of such a recommender system.MOTIVATIONS & PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS:The current recommender systems tend to misfire when user history is not known or new products are introduced into the mix. Missing user ratings add more complexity and create hindrances to relevant recommendations. Also, the current websites, especially in the domain of  food or travel, don't allow me to do a contextual search, like \"best chicken tikkas in South Delhi\". The results depend on the keywords appearing in the title or description, but rarely in the reviews + user browsing history.We have built two models using word2vec, which are;META MODEL: \nCreated with the user browsing history. This contains more than 9.4 million product histories. The attempt is to mimic and improve upon existing collaborative filtering systems.USER REVIEW MODEL:\nCurrently websites don\u2019t allow us to search on \u201ccontext\u201d. This model intakes reviews and attempts to create a framework for a \u201ccontextual search engine\u201d.This is our attempt to propose and demonstrate a framework that\u2019s more rounded and preserves context while generating recommendations. The current architecture looks something like this;The top results have high affinity among each other, and occur in Amazon\u2019s website itself in the \u201calso bough/also viewed\u201d section.

We will present the current status of development, how things are\nimplemented internally, why we chose C++, benchmarks, and examples of usage\nfrom Python (SymPy and Sage), Ruby and Julia.SymPy is a widely used symbolic manipulation library in Python. While SymPy\nturns out to be very useful for many applications, one of the long term\nproblems with SymPy is that the speed might be insufficient when handling of\nvery large expressions is required. Another problem with SymPy is that due to\nbeing written in Python, it can be cumbersome to use from other languages like\nJulia, Ruby, JavaScript or C++, because it requires, say, a Python to Julia\nbridge, which might not always be robust and which inflicts additional\noverhead.For these reasons, we implemented SymEngine, an open source C++ symbolic\nmanipulation library, with the goal of being the fastest library for symbolic\nmanipulation (opensource or commercial), and allowing natural wrappers to other\nlanguages like Python (the most mature wrapper), Ruby, Julia and others.We will show benchmarks against other computer algebra systems (opensource and\ncommercial) as well as examples of usage from Python (SymPy and Sage), Ruby and\nJulia. We will present a roadmap how to port SymPy on top of SymEngine.We will talk about why we chose C++ and what rules to follow so that the code\ncannot have an undefined behavior in Debug mode (thus providing similar ease of\ndevelopment as one is used to from Python).The SymEngine C++ library already has 36 contributors, 109 forks and 146 stars\non GitHub, as of June 30, 2016.SymEngine should fix the slowness of SymPy, while providing a familiar\ninterface, and at the same allowing many languages to naturaly use it, thus\ncreating a common platform/tool that many projects (like SymPy, Sage, ...) can\nuse as their main symbolic engine and all contribute back to it.", "Section:": "Scientific Computing", "Content URLs:": "Contents of presentation prepared by the SymEngine team lies here https://github.com/certik/scipy-2016-symengine-talk/", "Last Updated:": "\n01 Jul, 2016\n", "Speaker Links:": "Github     : https://github.com/Sumith1896 \nWebpage : https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~sumith/ \nTwitter     : https://twitter.com/sumith1896 \nE-mail      : sumith1896@gmail.com You can even reach me on Facebook.

Token based Authentication system using JWT (JSON Web Token)\n": {"Speaker Info:": "Information:Talks: Conference attended:Hackathons:", "Target Audience:": "\n                        Intermediate\n                    ", "comments": [], "Prerequisites:": "", "n_votes": 3, "Description:": "JWT is standard for making authentication token. JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure, enabling the claims to be digitally signed or integrity protected with a Message Authentication Code (MAC) and encrypted.Unlike session based authentication, Token based authentication system takes very less load of server. In session based authentication system, maintaining of session storage is requires processing and storage. While as Token based authentication system, it is not required to maintain session storage at server side. Tone of processing and storage will be saved. Beauty of using JWT as authentication token is it's simplicity. Once token is created, it is possible to authenticate user without touching the database again. Token can be discarded when it is expired by time from the expire time mentioned in token itself. The JWT is self contained token which has authentication, expire time information and any other user defined claims digitally signed. JWT can be used to provide Token Based Authentication system at your ReST API. Because JWT is self contained with required claims it is possible to scale API without depending on Authentication server. Oauth 2.0 uses JWT as token exchange standard. Using JWT is simple and more efficient when we have to design authentication system for our internal client who are not user of any Oauth provider like Gmail, Facebook etc. OAuth 2.0 contains many payload values which increase token size and it requires time to transfer where as using JWT, it is possible to get small size token with best security as Oauth 2.0By Jaysinh ShuklaRole: Full stack developerGithub:1 http://github.com/ultimatecoder2 http://github.com/jsh-odooTwitter: @jaysinhpEmail: jaysinhp@gmail.comIRC: thebigjClient sends authentication credentials (username and password) to Server.Server verifies authentication credentialsClient stores session id probably at Cookie storage.

Software RequirementsSoftware Used:Talk DescriptionThe ATMEGA328PU analog to digital convertor is bootloaded with data acquition bootloader available from the AVR too chain set.Here in this project, I have connected DHC11 temperature sensor to a ATMEGA328PU  which is powered by the Raspberry Pi 3.0. The DHC11 temperature sensor senses the temperature and the ATMEGA328PU  sends the collected data to Raspberry Pi 3.0. The Raspberry Pi 3.0 receives the data from the  ATMEGA328PU and displays a chart of the data against time. Verification of whether the temperature sensor DHC11 can acquire accurate temperature with the user varying the temperature near the sensor using a match stick or by sticking his/her finger on the temperature sensor DHC11.The data can further be used from the end user\u2019s purposes such as indicating a surge in temperature, and or display heat maps.The software part of acquiring data is written entirely in Python. I wrote python programs that are capable of sending messages to mobiles and email address of particular people.5. Scope for future workThe data collected from the DHC11 can be used to develop home automation tools such as  gesture control modules that make home automation tools more interesting towards user centric automation.There is a lot of future work in terms of applications in fields of Media, Entertainment Systems, Infrastructure Management, Manufacturing, Medical and Health care Systems, Transportation, and Large Scale deployments.

The focus now, is on building inexpensive and intelligent robots that can think on their own. And as they grow more complex, robotic systems are becoming increasingly concurrent. With massive development efforts being undertaken all over the world in robotics, there is a need to have a common framework that allows code and hardware sharing and is scalable to allow numerous concurrent processes.Robot Operating System (ROS) is one such framework, that is the de facto standard for robotics software development across the world. It is successfully being used in industry, academia and personal projects to allow robots to talk to each other and work collectively. ROS is open source and language independent, with Python and C++ being its most popular implementations. It also provides tools and libraries for obtaining, building, writing, and running code across multiple computers. If you want to be part of the ongoing robotics revolution,  learning ROS will let you choose from the affordable TurtleBot, the capable and friendly Baxter , or even NASA\u2019s Robonaut, currently undergoing testing on the International Space Station.

Music cannot be solved by a simple set of formulae. The most interesting and challenging part is producing unique music without infringing the copyright. The generated music has to sound good, and what sounds good is very subjective. The model is mainly built for producing Indian music.Artificial Neural Network/Deep Learning has wide range of application, such as in Image processing, Natural language processing, Time series prediction, etc. But what about its usage in art? This talk shows how deep learning was used to generate music.Deep learning attempts to model high-level abstractions in data by using multiple processing layers whereas the traditional Machine learning algorithms emphasizes on what work the computer program must do after it is given a data set. The basic idea in deep learning is  to perform an unsupervised learning procedure on every single layer in addition to using gradient descent for the network as a whole.

What I find compelling about GTK+ is that \"A chair() is still a chair()\". What I mean is that the GTK+ API comes very naturally to a beginner without having to remember special names. The very name of the classes and their inheritance model is easily understandable.If you follow the link to sample programs under \"Content urls\", you will find the codes there really simple and generic.

Pre-processing the data to handle missing values, categorical features and columns with low information content becomes as important as the algorithm you have chosen.PyProfound is an open-source desktop application built using electron.js and Python, that takes a dataset of your choice and returns a machine learning model which scores the best on cross-validation among all combinations possible on Scikit-Learn.

While a naive search bar that simplified information extraction and delivery of web pages was the rage in early 2000s, exponential increase in data and information on the Internet is making it natural for the search bar to evolve into a smarter and responsive interface. Not only can this search bar be more responsive in terms of guiding users in an iterative aka conversation based search, but it can also be assistive in fetching information that suits the interests of different users. Sooner or later, such conversational interface will replace the old-generation search bar.However, building such conversational interface has several technology challenges: a) the interface has to understand and extract intent from natural human inputs in terms of text or speech (this is partly done by the current generation search interfaces), b) it has to generate meaningful dialogue responses to engage users into a conversation, c) it has to understand and use context to assist users in fetching the most relevant information, and while doing so d) make the information results personalized to the user as she uses the interface over time.How do we solve these technology challenges? Is the \u2018conversational search\u2019 a hype or soon to be reality? How are recent advances in deep learning playing their role towards building such \u2018chat bots\u2019? How can we build a real interactive search interface using existing web (or Django) and machine learning frameworks. In this talk, I will take a deep dive to answer these questions and present the state of the art in building conversational agents during Django and Tensorflow (and Python, of course!). Tensorflow is a machine/deep learning package (using Python) open sourced by Google and has several advanced features to parse user text queries and personalize search results.Specifically, I will talk about building Django-based rest frameworks without and with websockets to enable interactive text search interfaces. Such interfaces are expected to become pervasive in coming years to replace web search bar, e-commerce search bars or any domain specific search engines such as education, healthcare etc. I will talk about implementation details of API using Django to enable such interface.

We have to keep the mirrors in sync, poke CI when all the mirrors are up-to-date, and notify the admins when something goes wrong. Managing all of this is a big task, especially when networks are bad, servers don't sync and daemons crash.To solve this problem, what started out as a set of ad-hoc scripts became a full blown piece of server software built to manage a fleet of git mirrors.

In his post, Samuele showed that the Python 2.2 method resolution order is not monotonic and he proposed to replace it with the C3 method resolution order. Guido agreed with his arguments and therefore now Python 2.3 uses C3.Hence, Python uses two algorithms for method resolution order. The Old MRO algorithm is very straight forward but the new one is not so easy to bring out.

From millions of products existing on a website, it is very difficult for a user to land on a product of his need as well as his choice.

Ensemble Models\n": {"Speaker Info:": "A tech enthusiast and an optimist, pursuing his Bachelors in Computer Science & Engineering at the National Institute Of Technology, Karnataka. Finshed my second year of engineering and interning at Unnati Data Labs.", "Target Audience:": "\n                        Beginner\n                    ", "comments": [], "Prerequisites:": "Basic knowledge on machine learning and usage of python libraries like sklearn, pandas.", "n_votes": 1, "Description:": "It is relatively easy to build a first-cut machine learning model. But what does it take to build a reasonably good model, or even a state-of-art model ?Ensemble models. They are our best friends. They help us exploit the power of computing. Ensemble methods aren\u2019t new. They form the basis for some extremely powerful machine learning algorithms like random forests and gradient boosting machines. The key point about ensemble is that consensus from diverse models are more reliable than a single source. This talk will cover how we can combine model outputs from various base models to create a stronger/better model output.This talk will cover various strategies to create ensemble models.Using third-party Python libraries along with scikit-learn, this talk will demonstrate the following ensemble methodologies: 1) Weighted Average 2) Stacking 3)BlendingReal-life examples from the enterprise world will be show-cased where ensemble models produced better results consistently when compared against single best-performing models.We at Unnati Data Labs have built a package for performing the ensembling of machine learning models.The motivation was to incorporate the various techniques described into a single python package. The current version of the package has the power to perform weighted averaging, and build stacking and blending models for binary classification. The other ensembling techniques will be incorporated in the future. The package enables data encoding, the desired data on which the user wishes to classify the data, can be encoded in many different ways like label encoding (categorical encoding), one hot encoding, sum encoding, polynomial encoding, backward difference encoding, helmert encoding, and hashing encoding. The encoded data will then be used to train the base models. The package provides the user with the ability to build a number of base models such as Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Multi Layer Perceptron, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression. The user can build any or all the base models with default parameter values, change the parameter values or provide a list of parameter values to perform hyper parameter optimistaion (Using Hyperopt and Grid Search) and identify the optimum parameter values. Once the desired parameter values have been obtained the respective base models will be trained. Upon training the models, the trained models are used to obtain predictions on the cross validation data, these predictions obtained from the base models will be used to construct a data frame, which will be used to train the stacking and blending models, and perform weighted averaging.Once the base models have been trained the user can select which ensembling technique to use. The dataframe of predictions will be used to perform weighted averaging, the same dataframe will be used to train the stacking model, for training the blending model the dataframe of predictions will be appended with the cross validation data. To train the ensemble models the algorithm or classifier which will be used can be any of the algorithms/classifiers provided for the training of the base models. For testing the stacking and blending models we can hold out a test set which can be used to examine how well these ensemble models perform, wether they overfit, underfit, provide better performance than the base models.Why this package stands out? First of, the package enables data encoding which provides more flexibility and information which can imporve the performance of the models. The package utilizes hyperopt and gridsearch to perform hyper parameter optimization, so at the time of training the models, we have the optimum parameter values which yields improved performance. Since ensembling involves building and training multiple models with the option of performing hyper parameter optimization, time taken to train these models becomes an issue. To tackle this issue the package makes use of the joblib library for parallelization. With the help of joblib, the various base models are trained in parallel, also the predictions on the cross validation data are obtained by running the predict functions in parallel. For the ensemble models the training of the different ensemble models are done in parallel, so is the testing phase of the ensemble models. This has enabled for a fast, robust, well defined package with immense potential in the world of machine laeenring.The package is still in its primary stage, and will continue to be worked upon. Some of the key areas to work on will be adding more base models as well as different ensembling techniques and also expanding to regression, multi class classification and more.Creating better models is the critical component of building a good data science product.", "Section:": "Data Visualization and Analytics", "Content URLs:": "Ensemble Package (Link)\nhttps://github.com/unnati-xyz/ensemble-package", "Last Updated:": "\n25 Jul, 2016\n", "Speaker Links:": "https://in.linkedin.com/in/prajwal967https://github.com/prajwal967", "Type:": "Talks"}, "\n6.

Most services are implemented as a container under the hood. Traditionally,\nyou would deploy django to some virtual machine instance.  PaaS has been the buzz word for quite \nsometime now, and is paving way for CaaS - Container as a Service. Containers, most often use Docker \nto produce immutable, isolated and quick to sign up application images.With containers there have been few known challenges:How do multiple containers talk to each other?How do I horizontally scale my container service?How do multiple container services discover each other?How do we secure our container network?How do we deploy new containers and roll back previous ones?To answer the above problems and address the issue of orchestration, scheduling and other automation tasks Kubernets \nwas released by Google.
