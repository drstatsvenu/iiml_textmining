In order to deal with uncertainty intelligently, we need to be able to represent it and reason about it. - Joseph HalpernThe problem of reasoning rationally in the face of uncertain knowledge presents itself in domains as diverse as engineering, medicine, ecology, and business. The pragmatic solution to this problem is to combine Boolean logic (which is the mathematics of certain propositions) with Bayesian probability (which is the mathematics of uncertainty). This combination provides us with a powerful semantic framework that allows us to Given this tremendous expressive power, it is not surprising that many of today's cutting-edge machine learning, artificial intelligence and data science, algorithms are based on a combination of logic and probability. The emerging field of probabilistic programming attempts to provide a coherent computational framework for reasoning under uncertainty. In this workshop, we want to introduce these ideas to the Python programming community. The aim of the workshop is to provide a short theoretical introduction to reasoning under uncertainty  followed by a long hands-on session where the theory is fleshed out by analyzing real life situations, casting them as problems of reasoning under uncertainty, and solving the problems using Python tools.The workshop will prepare participants to take on challenges in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science. We want to use standard tools in the Python data and visualization toolchain to accomplish the aim above. Instead of using a monolithic toolkit, we want to combine the building blocks provided by the excellent Python modules mentioned below to show the participant how they can create their own cutting-edge reasoning, inference, and learning algorithms. It is recommended that all participants have the Anaconda distribution pre-installed on their laptops. The theoretical introduction will cover The hands-on will coverThe real life applications we want to present  areNOTE : the examples above can be revised depending on feedback. At the end of the workshop, participants will be able to analyze a problem in their domain to decide if it can be treated as a problem of reasoning under uncertainty - surprisingly many problems can! They will be able to formulate their problem in standard Python tools (Scipy, Pandas, NetworkX) and arrive at answers to questions of inference, learning and decision making. They will be able to present these answers in an appealing visual form, ready for \ndissemination on the web.

Let's lay out the testing scenario. Assume, through one method or another, I've obtained the clear-text password for a single user - Bob. I have Bob's Windows credentials and can easily, through RDP or psexec, access his machine. I've determined that Bob is a Linux Administrator. I wish to determine what, if any, Linux servers allow me to log in as \"root\" using Bob's compromised password.For this exercise, I'll be interacting with Metasploit via the RPC interface (rather than directly with the console). The RPC interface allows clients to locally or remotely execute Metasploit commands, including running aux modules and exploits, interacting with sessions, talking to a database, etc. Python, a popular scripting language, can communicate over RPC. Therefore, I can write a Python script to \"remote control\" my Metasploit instance.At the end, you can interact with the established sessions through the open msfconsole or create additional scriptable events executed through the Python script. Of course, my entire example that i would demonstrate would be a bit contrived, considering the same could be accomplished simply through msfconsole and by setting the RHOSTS option to the 10.0.1.1/24.

Any dataset that isn't properly curated and stored can suffer from many problems like having mixed data types, not being properly encoded or escaped, uneven number of fields, and so on. None of these problems are unsolvable. In fact, most of us are pretty good at cleaning data. Normally, when we know little or nothing about a given dataset, we proceed in a very predictable manner. We first try to read the data naively and see if errors are raised by the parser. If they are, we try to fix our function calls. When those are fixed, we try to run some sanity checks on the data, and end up filtering the dataset, sometimes quite heavily.The problem with this process is that it is iterative, and worse, it is reactive. Everybody in the team has to do it if they are to use the dataset. Sure, one can simply clean it up and dump it in a new file with just a few lines of code. But we shouldn't have to run that script every time we encouter a new dataset. We would be much more comforable if data is cleaned as it is read. It is much more efficient if data cleaning is a part of data ingestion. Secondly, and more importantly, cleaning data via ad-hoc Python scripts is non trivial. Readable as Python scripts might be, it's not always easy for everyone in the team to change the cleaning process. Moreover, there are no Python libraries that offer an abstraction at the level of cleaning and validating data.Therefore, if one has to go through the process of data validation and cleaning in a customizable, modular way, one has to make sure that:PySemantic is a Python module that automates all of this, and more.

I'm extremely active on Twitter and during big events, often open up my Python console and take quick digs at checking out how they're spreading. At Airwoot, we work with social-data on a daily basis and feedback from our clients has led us to believe analytics is one of our stronger suits. Our tech stack is completely Python with databases spread across PostgreSQL and MongoDB. We have been using Apache Storm for our analytics over the last few months and have derived fantastic value off it.

With social media, even more so. There are a lot of options re: task and messaging queues, for e.g. celery, RabbitMQ etc. Both are broker-centric and maintain a state of every event which happens and this leaves an extra dependency layer. Storm, however, works completely within it's own layer when it comes to consumption and processing of tasks. This immediately makes it more lightweight and easier to maintain.   Storm is an open-source distributed \"real-time\" computing system. It processes as it receives and is often looked at as the real-time counterpart to Hadoop's batch-processing prowess. It is based on a \"topology\" architecture divided into two computing units: Spouts and Bolts. Spouts generate the data and feed it to Bolts which process it and may/may not feed it to further bolts. Storm is scalable, guarantees the processing of any data that has been generated, simple to setup and can be used with any language.

A user will enter his / her requirements using Natural language.  The system will do a natural language processing of the input text.  Machine learning models will be used to predict the needed fields. This solution can be used for different use cases including agent allocations for Incident work bench ,  Recommendation services , etc. This presentation is based on our experience in creating and deploying  a large scale prediction system which is being used live across all employees of our company. \nPresentation will bring out\n1.  Challenges in text classification\n2.  Steps needed in text classification\n3.  Why Python is suitable for this task and How we can solve some of the challenges using Python\n4.  How to build a working text classifier in PythonSystem is built using combination of Natural Language Processing techniques and machine learning techniques with Python as the predominant \nlanguage.\nTakeaways from the talk will include what to look for in text classification and how to build an actual text classifier in Python.About Prediction Systems\nAcross different systems there is a need for users to select different options. Users need to select one from many possibilities. For example if you have a complaint you would need to select under which category this complaint has to be raised.  ( Department , sub group, specific class, etc ). Larger the number of possibilities more effort is needed from the end user to be able to narrow down on the correct selection. In many cases there is a hierarchical tree which has to be navigated for the user to be able to reach the correct selection.  If a top level selection is wrong user will never be shown the correct option which he  / she can choose.  Classification systems attempt to correctly assign to correct option for a given request.  If it is hierarchical selection the system should be able to predict across all levels.Machine Learning in Python. \nThe heart of the prediction systems are the machine learning algorithms. Python has strong support for machine learning algorithms. The key package we will use is the scikit-learn package. This package is powerful and enables developers with minimal machine learning experience to develop powerful classification systems.

Humans have the capability to see and interpret the environment around them. Computer Vision aims to impart a similar capability to machines, wherein they are able to take in data from the outside world and perform tasks accordingly. The data that they acquire is essentially a set of image frames from the camera. Computer Vision makes use of algorithms to work on these images, and interpret them as needed.Computer Vision is a powerful tool, with which we can create applications for gesture and facial recognition, OCR, and also extend this to give vision to robots.The most popular library that is used for Computer Vision is the openCV library.

Well, thats not impossible provided you have large data. Consider how our brain solve these problems- If we have not seen the words asked in the puzzle we can not solve such problems. We need contextual information about the words. Also, if you notice carefully both the problems are somewhat similar and only require your memory or precisely how you store contextual information.So is there any algorithm which can make it possible? This is what I am going to talk about. How can we build such contextual space of words.  Google's Word2Vec is able to solve both of the problems above.  To our pride there is an awesome implementation of it in python -- gensim.  I will be talking about how to train such model and everything we have to keep in mind while dealing with it.Word2Vec creates a model which you can easily query for some tasks.  You can easily ask your model  --if  man--> king  then  woman --> ?\nit replies happily  queen . Lets go more optimistic and ask  which of the one does not match ?\nbreakfast, cereal, dinner, lunch\n As you wished it says cerealTo achieve this accuracy we need  ample amount of data to build contextual space for each word.
